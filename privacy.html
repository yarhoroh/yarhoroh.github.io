                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 30, 2024</p>

                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>Murmur ("the Application") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our voice-to-text application.</p>

                <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>The Application does not require you to create an account or provide any personal information to use its core features.</p>
                <p><strong>Audio Data:</strong> When you use the voice-to-text feature, audio is captured from your microphone. This audio is processed entirely on your local device using AI models and is immediately discarded from memory after processing. We do not transmit, store, or have access to your audio recordings.</p>
                <p><strong>Transcription History:</strong> Transcribed text may be stored locally on your device if you choose to save it. This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly share or export it.</p>

                <h2>3. Local Processing</h2>
                <p>All speech recognition processing occurs locally on your device. Your voice data is never sent to external servers. The Application uses on-device AI models to convert speech to text, ensuring your conversations remain private.</p>

                <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
                <p>Any data stored by the Application (such as settings or transcription history) is kept locally on your device. Data security is protected by your device's operating system security features and any personal access controls you have in place.</p>

                <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>The Application does not integrate with any third-party analytics platforms, advertising networks, or external APIs for its core functionality.</p>
                <p><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> If you purchase a Pro subscription, payment is processed by Paddle.com Market Limited. Paddle collects necessary payment information according to their <a href="https://www.paddle.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. We do not have access to your full payment details.</p>
                <p><strong>Microsoft Store:</strong> If you download the Application from Microsoft Store, your download and any purchases are subject to Microsoft's terms and privacy policy.</p>

                <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
                <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>View your locally stored transcription history within the Application</li>
                    <li>Delete individual transcriptions or clear all history</li>
                    <li>Uninstall the Application to remove all associated data from your device</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>The Application is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

                <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>

                <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
                <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact:</p>
